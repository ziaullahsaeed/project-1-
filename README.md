# Automatic Machine Fault Detection and Recognition

## Project Overview
This repository contains code and resources for a project focused on automatic machine fault detection and recognition using computer vision techniques. The project specifically targets the detection and classification of faults such as Corona, Arcing, Looseness, and Tracking in industrial machines.

## Utilized Model
For fault detection and recognition, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with dropout layers is employed. The CNN is trained using extracted features from visual data representing machine components with various faults.

## Setup Instructions
To replicate the results and run the code, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/your-username/automatic-machine-fault-detection.git
2. Install required libraries using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Ensure that necessary datasets and pretrained models are in their respective directories.
4. Execute the main script or Jupyter Notebook file to train the model and assess its performance.
